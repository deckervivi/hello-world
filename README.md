Hi there!

I've just finished my banana-oatmeal pancake. 
For this easy and quick meal you only need:
- 1 banana
- 2 eggs
- a cup of oat meal
- half tea spoon baking powder
- blender

Mix all the ingredients and pour the mixture to a hot pan. 
Also don't forget to melt some butter first so the pancake won't stick in the pan.
That's it!

I added nutella and some raspberries on the top. Yummy!

Now I have to go and do some squats :/
